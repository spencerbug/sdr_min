# Issue tracking for remaining work to get to a functional Examiner demo.

1. **Formalize context gating fallback for the Examiner loop.** Implement a tiny `context_gates` helper that returns an all-ones vector, wire it through `ColumnSystem`/`run_loop`, and add a unit test so the launch build defaults to static gates.
2. **Add a dedicated Examiner runner script under `examples/`.** Create `examples/examiner_minimal.py` (or similar) that instantiates `LoopConfig` for a single column, runs ~100 steps, and prints the summary so collaborators have a one-command demo.
3. **Update docs and README with the runner workflow.** Document how to invoke the new example, clarify the static-gate assumption, and surface any required config knobs for the first public demo.
4. **Adopt the shared configuration schema.** Ensure the runner consumes `EnvConfig` via `EnvConfig.from_dict`, document the examiner defaults alongside the schema in `ENVIRONMENT.md`, and provide a sample JSON/YAML config that mirrors the documented fields.
5. **Expose Habitat toggle in the runner.** Add a config/CLI flag so the runner instantiates either the stub adapter or the Habitat adapter based on user choice (stub remains default).
6. **Provision a black void Habitat scene with origin-loaded objects.** Use `scripts/generate_void_scene.py` to emit `assets/scenes/examiner/void_black.glb`, ensure the adapter drops YCB meshes at the origin table pose, and document the expected asset layout.
7. **Implement the Habitat-backed Examiner adapter.** Replace the stub path with a Habitat-Sim implementation that initialises sensors, renders RGB-D patches from the void scene, emits pose/context packets, and respects the documented orbit controls.
8. **Pipe step metrics to lightweight logs.** Capture entropy, peakiness, and action counts each tick (CSV/JSONL) so we can compare runs and debug without attaching a debugger.
9. **Dump sample facet reconstructions for inspection.** Save the top shared facet predictions (e.g., as PNG/NPZ) after each run to validate that facet plumbing works end-to-end.
10. **Add an integration test around the example runner.** Extend the smoke suite with a pytest that executes the example for a short horizon and asserts deterministic summary stats/log artifacts for both stub and Habitat modes (skipping Habitat when assets are unavailable).
